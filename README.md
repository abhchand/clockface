# Clockface

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/abhchand/clockface.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/abhchand/clockface)

A lightweight UI for the [Clockwork gem](https://github.com/Rykian/clockwork) to easily schedule and manage background jobs.

![Clockface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhchand/clockface/master/meta/screenshot.png)

Clockface serves as a **complete UI wrapper** on top of clockwork -

- It includes and configures clockwork directly so you only have to worry about configuring one thing - Clockface
- It doesn't add any new functionality on top of clockwork. It simply adds a UI for management and execution

##### Multi Tenancy

Clockface also supports schema-based multi-tenancy!

It also includes out-of-the-box support for the [apartment gem](https://github.com/influitive/apartment) in particular.

See the [Multi Tenancy section](#multi_tenancy) below.
